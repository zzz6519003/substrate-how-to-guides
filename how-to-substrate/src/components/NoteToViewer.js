            The <strong> Substrate how-to guide book</strong> intends to help
            new and experienced Substrate developers to do just that. By
            building things up from simple components, the purpose of this book
            is to serve as a "how-to" guide for developers looking to understand
            integration techniques of both simple and more complex capabilities
            that Substrate and FRAME offers.
