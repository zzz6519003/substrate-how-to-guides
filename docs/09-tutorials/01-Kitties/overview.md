# 😺 Substrate Kitties

_This is a two-part tutorial series that steps you through building a pallet for managing Substrate
Kitties from scratch. Each part could take between 1.5 and 3 hours to complete depending on your
level of experience with Substrate._

## Introduction

Welcome to the Substrate Kitties tutorial. This two-part tutorial designed to teach you everything
you need to know to build a blockchain designed to handle the creation and ownership management of
Substrate Kitties. Part 1 will cover how to build the Kitties pallet, including the functionality to
interact with the Kitties we create, such as transfering, buying and setting prices. Part 2 will
cover developing the Front-end UI to interact with the blockchain we build in Part 1.

You may find it useful to come back to this page as you progress through each part &mdash; just to
keep track of the bigger picture.

### What we're building

In Part 1 of this tutorial, we intentionally keep things simple so that you can decide on how you
would like to improve your Substrate Kitties chain later on. For the purposes of what we are
building, Kitties really can only do the following things:

:smiley_cat: &nbsp; Be created either by some original sources or by being bred using existing Kitties.

:smirk_cat: &nbsp; Be sold at a price set by their owner.

:pouting_cat: &nbsp; Be transferred from one owner to another.

**In Part 1, we'll go over:**


1. [**Basic setup**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/basic-setup) - we will need to spin up a
Substrate node and create a custom pallet.

2. [**Runtime storage**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/basic-setup) - we will need a total of
three storage items in our pallet to keep track of the amount of Kitties, their owners, and a `Kitty`
object containing a single Kitty's information.

3. [**Dispatchable functions**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/dispatchables-and-events) - we will
need a total of 5 dispatchable functions: `create`, `set_price`, `transfer`, `buy_kitty`, and
`breed_kitty`.

4. [**Private functions**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/create-kitties) - we will write a few
helper functions to handle the heavy lifting logic, and

5. [**Helper functions**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%201/interacting-functions) - we will write
two helpers functions for our dispatchable functions: `mint` and `transfer_from`.

**In Part 2, we will:**

1. [**Create a UI for interacting with our pallet's storage items**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%202/kitties-frontend)
- we will connect to the Substrate Front-end Template and create UI components for each dispatchable call.

2. [**Enhance our UX with Polkadot JS API**](/docs/Tutorials/Kitties/Part%202/kitties-frontend). 

:::info
In any case, if you are stuck in following the tutorial, you can always refer back to the full
working source code in the following locations:

- On Substrate side, it is under [Substrate Node Template repository `tutorials/kitties` branch](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template/tree/tutorials/kitties).
Most of the code changes are under `/pallets/kitties/src/lib.rs`.

- On the front end side, it is under the [Substrate Front-end Template repository `tutorials/kitties` branch](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template/tree/tutorials/kitties).
Most of the code changes are within these three files:
`/src/[Kitties.js, KittyCards.js, KittyAvatar.js]`.

### What we won't cover

The following fall outside the scope of this tutorial:

- Writing tests for our pallet.

You can refer to the [how-to guides](/docs/intro) on how to do this once you've completed this
tutorial series.

:::tip
Follow each step at your own pace &mdash; the goal is for you to learn and the best way to do that
is to try it yourself!

Use the side panel to write your code as you follow along (coming soon). Before moving on from one
section to the next, make sure your pallet builds without any error.

You'll be writing most of the code yourself! Use the template files [here](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-how-to-guides/tree/main/static/code/kitties-tutorial)
to help you complete each part.

## Learning outcomes

:arrow_right: &nbsp; Write and integrate a custom FRAME pallet to your runtime.

:arrow_right: &nbsp; Use structs in storage and how to create and update storage items.

:arrow_right: &nbsp; Write pallet extrinsics and helper functions.

:arrow_right: &nbsp; Use the PolkadotJS API to connect a Substrate node to a custom a front-end.

<!-- ## Steps

### [1. Basic set-up](basic-setup)

- Create a pallet and integrate it to your runtime
- Include a simple storage items to keep track of all Kitties
- Build and check your pallet

### [2. Create unique Kitties and their storage items](create-kitties)

- Write a struct to store details about our Kitties
- Implement the Randomness trait to create unique Kitties
- Use `StorageValue` and `StorageMap` to create the remainingn of your pallet's storage items

### [3. Dispatchables and Events](extrinsics-and-events)
- Write a dispatchable that updates runtime storage using a helper function
- Write and use pallet Events

### [4. Interacting with your Kitties](interacting-functions)

- Write a dispatchable to set the price for a Kitty
- Create a transfer capabilities for a Kitty
- Write a dispatchable to buy a Kitty
- Write a dispatchable to breed two Kitties

### [5. Viewing Kitties in a UI](kitties-frontend)

- Connect your chain to the Substrate front-end template
- Use PolkadotJS API to customize the frontend
- Interact with your chain
